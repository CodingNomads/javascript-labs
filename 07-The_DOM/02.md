Now its time to make your page dynamic. Make a button somewhere on your page that says "dark mode". Using event listeners, make it so that when the button is pressed, the page shifts from using light backgrounds and dark text to dark backgrounds and light text. This will involve manipulating your CSS. Do it by manipulating the style characteristics of the various elements in your CSS.

Since you only have one background color and one text color, and minimal amount of elements, then it should not take too many lines of code to get this working.
