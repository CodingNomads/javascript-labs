/**
 * The function above is a random number generator. It generates a number
 * between 1 and 10. Don't worry about how it works, its just a tool to practice
 * with right now. Do not modify the function, only modify anything below this
 * comment block.
 *
 * Using the random number generator, the variable defined below becomes a
 * random number between 1 and 20.
 *
 * With the HTML file from this folder (test.html) loaded in Chrome and the
 * console open refresh the browser (F5) various times and look at the console.
 * Notice how the number is different each time!
 *
 * Once you have seen how it works, you can delete the code below.
 *
 * Then do the following
 *
 *      1. Create 3 variables, one with a random number between 1 and 100
 *         called "age", one initialized to 0 called "price" and one
 *         with an empty string ("") called "fare".
 *      2. Write some conditional statements to simulate bus ticket
 *         cost. Something like: Under 5s go free, under 13s pay
 *         child fare, under 21s pay teenager fare, under 30s pay young
 *         person fare, under 65s pay adult fare, and over 65s pay
 *         pensioner fare.
 *      3. Within each condition, assign the price to be paid and the name
 *         of the fare to the appropriate variables.
 *      4. Log a message to the console with a message like: "You pay the
 *         young person fare, that will be 5 dollars, please."
 *
 * Once you have this working, see if you can implement a way to give each
 * passenger a 1 in 10 chance of going free, and modify the message with
 * something like "Lucky you! Today you get to ride free of charge."
