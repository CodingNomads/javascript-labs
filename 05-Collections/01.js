/**
 * 1. Create an array of strings of the names of items in the room you are sitting
 *    in. For example "chair", "keyboard" etc
 * 2. Now think of some drawers or shelves or boxes that you have nearby. Make a
 *    array with a sub-array for each drawer or box, and array 5 things in each. Do
 *    this for 3 boxes. You should have a two dimensional array.
 * 3. Pick 5 things from the two dimensional array just created, and log them to
 *    the console using array referencing.
 * 4. Use a for loop to build a array of the numbers from 1 to 100.
 * 5. Use another for loop to go through the array of numbers just created and
 *    log the sum of all the numbers.
 * 6. Use the random number generator from previous labs and another for loop to
 *    create a array of 100 random numbers.
 * 7. Use another for loop to go over each of these random numbers and put them
 *    in one of two arrays. One for odd numbers, and one for even numbers.
 * 8. Make the for loop that logs the sum of all the numbers in an array into a
 *    function that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum. Use this
 *    function to log the sum of the two arrays of odd and even numbers.
