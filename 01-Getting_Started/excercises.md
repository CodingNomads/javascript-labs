# Getting into it

## 1 Get Organized

Take some time, as much time as you feel you need, to get organized for the course. Everyone has their own style for getting organized. Don't be afraid of taking a day or two. It's important to set up a physical working space, a virtual space in your computer, and a psychological space in your mind.

## 2 Create Habits

What to do when your motivation fades? Start listening to some programming podcasts on trips, while doing chores or exercise. Watch instructional YouTube videos when you need a break or a change of pace. Also, learn how to really rest when you need to, which sometimes means putting the phone down, closing your eyes and putting thoughts out of your mind. Many great minds have used this strategy to get their subconscious to start working on a problem.

## 3 Post in the forums

Have a think about your goals, long and short term, and share them in the forum or Slack.

More often than not, the personal connections you make on courses is where real development happens. It pushes you the extra mile, and prevents you from going down too many dead-ends. That said, dead-ends can be interesting! Share them!
