# Introduction to the labs

This is a short introduction to the labs and what to expect.

## Markdown files

You may note that some files, like this one, in the labs are `.md` files. These are Markdown files. Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language. Do you remember what HTML stands for? Hyper Text *Markup* Language.

> In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. (Wikipedia)

Thing is, HTML is quite unreadable, the tags overwhelm the actual content. The advantage HTML has is that its flexible, you have as many tag types as you can think of. Though if you only really want stylings for a few headers and a basic paragraph, then Markup cuts out the clutter and is easily convertible to HTML if you need.

## JavaScript files

The other main type of file you will encounter is the `.js` file. This is a JavaScript file. Here you will mostly have instructions that are comments, that is, they don't have any effect on what is executed. There may be a few lines of code for you to debug, or to get working, but for the most part, you will be filling these files with your code.

## Other files

The other files that are here, `.html` and `.css` files, are there to get you started with the labs. The first time you encounter JavaScript files, in the same folder you will find an HTML file. If you open this in your browser and then open the console, you will see that it prints some stuff to the console. Each JavaScript file is linked to the HTML to output its contents there.

The HTML files each reference a global style sheet that lives in the root folder of the labs. This is just for convenience. You won't need to change the global style sheet, unless you want to customize it to your liking!

## Workflow

For the most part, you should have Visual Studio Code open in one window and the browser in another. You will code a little and then save the file in VSCode and then refresh the browser to see the output.

In later labs you will probably want to modify the HTML as the output for each lesson can start to get very long. So you might want to mute the output of certain exercises. Eventually no HTML will be provided and you will be designing and making your own!
