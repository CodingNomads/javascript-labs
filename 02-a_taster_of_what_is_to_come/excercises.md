# Getting to grips with the world of JavaScript

## Initialize Note Taking

Create a new GitHub repository and give it a name, something along the lines of "notes and snippets" or "code snips and notes" or "my code notes" - here you can keep your own notes and "code snippets" - most programmers spend much of their time searching Google for code snippets - examples of code that they can adapt to their task. If you start building your own library. Not only will your learning go much faster. You will also be much faster at coding than most, since you will intimately know your own snippets, which are available at your fingertips. Don't be afraid to copy and paste small sections of code into your notes too, just make sure you understand everything that is going in, or at least make a note that you don't understand it! Last but not least, if you are copying code, try to attribute it where you can!

## Build a simple static website

To refresh your HTML and CSS knowledge. Create a one page HTML and CSS website. Go to [this website](https://www.javascriptinstitute.org/javascript-tutorial/history-of-javascript/) and use the article there for your text content. If you are new to HTML and CSS, best to take a short course like this one:

> https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css

You can take this in parallel to this course and skip over this exercise if you are going down this route. Just make sure you complete at least until "CSS text properties" before you get to the sections on the DOM in the last 25% of the course. Ideally, also finish the section entitled "CSS Layout" as this will really open the door for you in regards to making your websites look the way you envision them. Play the videos at 1.5x speed if you want to take it a bit quicker!

If you haven't already, identify some good reference sources for HTML and CSS. MDN and W3Schools are good bets. You will definitely need to consult these sources, as you will need to search Google and StackOverflow to gain info.

Tasks:

- Create a site title, a header, paragraphs, and a footer using appropriate divs.
- Add in your content.
- Now add in sub-headings summarizing the sections.
- Style it in any way you want, with a separate CSS file or within the HTML itself.
- Publish it on GitHub pages!

## Dev Tools

Set a timer for 20 minutes and explore some websites with the Dev Tools open. Just click around and see what stuff does. Have a look at the documentation if you are curious. There will be lessons coming up in the main course with more detail. If you want, the course linked above has a short section on the Dev Tools too.
