/**
 * In these questions you will be practicing how to use the forEach syntax.
 *
 * 1. Use a random number generator to generate an array of 100 values.
 * 2. Use forEach on the array to output the sum, count and average.
 * 3. Use forEach to create a new array from the first one that halves all the
 *    values.
 * 4. Use forEach on the new array to output the sum, count and average again.
 * 
 * 5. Use forEach loops with the random number generator to create a two
 *    dimensional array of 50 rows containing 50 random numbers each.
 *    
 *    [
 *     [2, 5, 32, 95, 12, 13, ... up to 50 numbers], // this is one row
 *     [ ... ],
 *     [ ... ],
 *     [ ... ],
 *     [ ... ],
 *     [ ... ],
 *     ... 50 rows
 *    ]
 * 
 *     
 * 6. Use forEach loops to iterate over every number, getting the sum, and
 *    average.
