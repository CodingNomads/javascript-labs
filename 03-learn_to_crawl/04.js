/**
 * Create three variables with numbers assigned to them.
 * Do not use zero.
 * Make the numbers at least 4 digits long, e.g. 3874, 2398.
 * Create a 4th variable with the number 7 and call it "luckyNumber".
 * 
 * After creating the variables, do the
 * following without typing any more numbers.

 *         numbers from the larger one.
 *      3. The result of multiplying all the numbers.
 *      4. The result of the largest number divided
 *         by the difference between the smaller ones.
 *      5. The result of the the numbers modulo 7.
 * 
 * Finally, label all of the outputs by using console log in the way
 * that is demonstrated below. For the labels, be sure to come up
