/**
 * Remember how you put the temperature converter functions to use when
 * converting a list of values? Well, now you will get to do the same for a
 * large object!
 *
 * Your challenge:
 *
 * 1. You'll find a huge JSON file in this folder it is an object that contains
 *    a large list of objects. Manually copy and paste the contents of that file
 *    below and start writing your script below that.
 * 2. Output to the console all the temperatures in Vancouver in Celsius,
 *    convert if needed.
 * 3. Output to the console all the temperatures in Jerusalem in Fahrenheit,
 *    convert if needed.
 * 4. Get the average temperatures for Vancouver and Jerusalem in both Celsius
 *    and Fahrenheit and output them to the console.
 * 5. Write a function that will return a chosen city's average temperature in
 *    either fahrenheit or celsius defined by two parameters as shown in the
 *    code below.
