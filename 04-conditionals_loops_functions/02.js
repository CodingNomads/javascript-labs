/**
 * You may want to modify the html file to mute the output of certain exercises,
 * this one for instance, will generate many lines of output. You can comment
 * out lines in HTML file (not this file, this is a JS file) with
 * <!-- comment --> tags.
 *
 * 1. Create a for loop that will log all the numbers between 5 and 1000.
 *    incrementing in 5s. So the output would start "5, 10, 15, 20 ..."
 * 2. Create a for loop that outputs every number between 100 and -100 included.
 * 
 * Lastly, a difficult one that you may not be able to get right away:
 * 
 * 3. Create a for loop that outputs this sequence of numbers: 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,
 *    9, 8 ... That is, if starting at 0: +3, -1, +3, -1, +3.
 *    For bonus points, make it output exactly 5000 numbers!
 *    So if the sequence is:
 *    3, 2, 5
 *    the count would be:
 *    1, 2, 3
 *    What is the number you get at the end?
 * 
 * This last one is very tricky! There is more than one way to solve it, and it
 * may take a few attempts spaced out over a few days.
 * 
 * HINT: To get a hint, uncomment the lines of code below and look at the output.
 * Don't worry about not understanding the code used for the hint, but feel
 * free to explore it!
