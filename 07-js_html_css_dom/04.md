# Developing it further

A note about developing this project further. If you make the CSS more complex, you should consider what approach you want to take. Here is a link to a good article about different approaches towards dark mode for example.

This is tricky ground because there are many caveats and different approaches to do the same thing, so be ready to look stuff up frequently if you are going to build a more complex website. This article is good because it lets you peek into the mindset of a developer implementing a feature like this.

For now though, you are done with this mini-project! Well done!
