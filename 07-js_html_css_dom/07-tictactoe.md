Now is a good time to get stuck in and try and build out a small interactive web page.

Your challenge is to make a working one page application where you can play 2 player tic-tac-toe!

## Recommended steps

- Take a sheet of paper and sketch out all the different elements you think you will need. What specific tools and methods will you be using.
- Create a Code Pen.
- Construct your basic HTML and CSS, ideally with JavaScript. Keep that code separate from your game logic. Doesn't have to be a separate file, but just try to break up your code into chunks that are easy to manage and understand.
- Find a way to turn a user click into an 'X' or a 'O' on the screen.
- Find a way to represent and store your game state.
- Find a way to get the user clicks into your game state.
- Find a way to implement turns.
- Find a way to figure out how to identify whether someone has won, or when it's a draw. Keep it simple!
- Find a way to reset the game once the two players are done.
- You should have a working game now, make it pretty, have the web page tell you whose turn it is and who won or if its a draw. Make a reset button.
- Publish it on GitHub Pages and show the world!
