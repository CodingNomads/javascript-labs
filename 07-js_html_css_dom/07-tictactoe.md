Now is a good time to get stuck in and try and build out a small interactive web page.

Your challenge is to make a working one page application where you can play 2 player tic-tac-toe!

## Recommended steps

- Take a sheet of paper and sketch out all the different elements you think you will need. What specific tools and methods will you be using.
- Construct very basic HTML and CSS. Assign event listeners with Javascript and not directly in the HTML. Keep the code that deals with displaying information to the user separate from the code that controls the status of the game.
- Find a way to represent and store your game state.
- Find a way to get the user clicks into your game state.
- Find a way to implement turns.
- Find a way to figure out how to identify whether someone has won, or when it's a draw. Keep it simple!
- Find a way to reset the game once the two players are done.
- Once you have this working in the game state, then move on to the display aspect.

The web page tell you whose turn it is and who won or if its a draw. Make a reset button.

Publish it on GitHub Pages and show the world!
